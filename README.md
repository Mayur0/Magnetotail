# Magnetotail
2nd PhD Project - Understanding Electron Populations in the Earth's Magnetotail

Cluster_ECLAT is used for reducing the dimensionality of electron 2D distributions functions and clustering the compressed data to understand the physical properties of each population. The Outliers workbook is used to analyse the times at which the Autoencoder had detected to be anomalous.
